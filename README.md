# WeatherApp
Using an API, this weather app allows you to input a city name to receive the daily or weekly weather forecast.

# Almost done...
# Things I need to work on / fix:
    • Fix Weekly Forecast ("daily" doesn't get processed through weekly_data[] on line 185)
    • Today's Forecast for some reason says "None" as the city even though the weather is received and no error is given.
