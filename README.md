# WeatherApp
Using an API, this weather app allows you to input a city name to receive the daily or weekly weather forecast.

# This is a Weather App that includes the following features:
    â€¢ I practiced a lot with APIs, maps, tkinter, and cross-class method interactions.
    
    â€¢ Buttons that opens different pages
    â€¢ An entry for a CITY, and labels change based on the API's data (using openweathermap.org)
    â€¢ Today's Forecast is presented on Page 2. It displays the city name, temperature, and weather description.
    â€¢ 5-Day Forecast (because the more advanced data requires premium $$$) is presented on Page 3. It displays the 5 consecutive dates, temperature, and weather description.
# Soon to come features:
    â€¢ Change between Kelvins, Celsius, Fahrenheit.
    â€¢ Use a more specific location (e.g. "Washington" is common throughout the world) However, using a [city][state code][country code] would be very easy to implement, but just takes unnecessary time when I can be learning more important things. Though, this is very practical to have, so I will revisit this very SOON!
    â€¢ I'LL MAKE IT PRETTY! ðŸ˜­ DON'T WORRY! I DRAW AND PAINT, SO AS AN ARTIST, I FEEL THE PAIN OF JUST A BASIC WINDOW. ðŸ¥¹ PLEASE BELIEVE IN ME.
